# Security Testing Techniques Lab

This project demonstrates a range of security testing techniques including intrusion detection, firewall configuration, encryption analysis, and vulnerability scanning.

All work was performed in an isolated lab environment as part of a Security Testing course.

## Topics Covered
- Intrusion Detection Systems (Snort)  
- Firewall configuration using iptables  
- Symmetric encryption using OpenSSL  
- Network scanning with Nmap  
- Static code analysis with FlawFinder
